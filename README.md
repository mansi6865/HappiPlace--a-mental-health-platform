# HappiPlace--a-mental-health-platform
HappiPlace is a mental health platform idea (only user interface yet), which aims to provide features like connecting to other people, getting therapy and also a novel idea of calculating a custom and a special index for every user of the application based on their heart rate, physical activity hours and number of sleep hours. 
This will help people to keep a track of their progress and also give an accurate idea of their mental and physical health to their therapists. The user interface is simple, minimalistic, and extremely easy to navigate.
